# Java Management Application
This is a project that I made as an university assigment. The whole purpose of it is to create a management system for a store. I mostly used Java for the visual interface, and SQL for the database that is running in the background. I opted for a simplistic design. My intent was to create an application that is easy to use even the first time you start it.
